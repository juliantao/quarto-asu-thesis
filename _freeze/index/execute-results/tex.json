Typically, Chapters 3--5 would contain your own contributions. Think of each of these as potential papers to be submitted to journals. Finally, Chapter 6 provides some concluding remarks, discussion, ideas for future research, and so on. Appendixes can contain additional material that don't fit into any chapters, but that you want to put on record. For example, additional tables, output, etc.\n\n## Quarto\n\nIn this template, the rest of the chapter shows how to use quarto. The big advantage of using quarto is that it allows you to include your R or Python code directly into your thesis, to ensure there are no errors in copying and pasting, and that everything is reproducible. It also helps you stay better organized.\n\nFor details on using Quarto, see <http://quarto.org>.\n\n## Data\n\nIncluded in this template is a file called `sales.csv`. This contains quarterly data on Sales and Advertising budget for a small company over the period 1981--2005. It also contains the GDP (gross domestic product) over the same period. All series have been adjusted for inflation. We can load in this data set using the following code:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nAny data you use in your thesis can go into the `data` directory. The data should be in exactly the format you obtained it. Do no editing or manipulation of the data prior to including it in the `data` directory. Any data munging should be scripted and form part of your thesis files (possibly hidden in the output).\n\n## Figures\n\n@fig-deaths shows time plots of the data we just loaded. Notice how figure captions and references work. Chunk names can be used as figure labels with `fig-` prefixed. Never manually type figure numbers, as they can change when you add or delete figures. This way, the figure numbering is always correct.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Quarterly sales, advertising and GDP data.](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-deaths-1.pdf){#fig-deaths}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Results from analyses\n\nWe can fit a dynamic regression model to the sales data.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nSeries: Sales \nModel: LM w/ ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)[4] errors \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1     sma1     GDP  AdBudget\n      0.2189  -0.9016  0.9742    2.2824\ns.e.  0.1022   0.0715  0.4387    0.3930\n\nsigma^2 estimated as 1677:  log likelihood=-493.94\nAIC=997.87   AICc=998.54   BIC=1010.69\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nIf $y_t$ denotes the sales in quarter $t$, $x_t$ denotes the corresponding advertising budget and $z_t$ denotes the GDP, then the resulting model is:\n$$\n  y_t - y_{t-4} = \\beta (x_t-x_{t-4}) + \\gamma (z_t-z_{t-4}) + \\phi_1 (y_{t-1} - y_{t-5}) + \\Theta_1 \\varepsilon_{t-4} + \\varepsilon_t\n$$ {#eq-drm}\nwhere\n$\\beta = 2.28$,\n$\\gamma = 0.97$,\n$\\phi_1 = 0.22$,\nand\n$\\Theta_1 = -0.90$. We can reference this equation using @eq-drm.\n\n## Tables\n\nLet's assume future advertising spend and GDP are at the current levels. Then forecasts for the next year are given in @tbl-salesforecasts.\n\n::: {#tbl-salesforecasts .cell .tbl-cap-location-bottom tbl-cap='Forecasts for the next year assuming Advertising budget and GDP are unchanged.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Quarter | Sales forecast|\n|:-------|--------------:|\n|2006 Q1 |         1000.2|\n|2006 Q2 |         1013.1|\n|2006 Q3 |         1076.7|\n|2006 Q4 |         1003.5|\n:::\n:::\n\nAgain, notice the use of labels and references to automatically generate table numbers.\n\n",
